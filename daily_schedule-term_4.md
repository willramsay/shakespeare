## Week 2
Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 17 

* Read *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and two short essays on Sh's use of 'thou' and 'you' &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and explicate 2-3 instances of Sh's use of 'thou' or 'you' in the play

Tuesday, Jan. 17 &mdash; *A Midsummer Night's Dream*

Preparation for Friday, Jan. 20 

* Read *The Tempest* and Crystal's essay on Sh's use of meter and prose &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and explain 2-3 instances of Sh's use of either prose or verse

Friday, Jan. 20 &mdash; *The Tempest*

* A theme in our discussion of *The Tempest* was Prospero: what is the nature of his magic? is he an analogue to the playwright? to what degree is he a 'moral' character? And indeed it was proposed that *The Tempest*, unlike *MND* is a character study, focusing on Prospero, Ariel, and especially Caliban. Is Caliban rational? What is the significance of the fact that his speeches are in verse? What to make of his attempted rape of Miranda? Why is he enslaved? What happens to him at the end of the play? But despite the proposed contrast with *MND* similarities were also pointed out: omnipotent characters (Prospero, Oberon), agents (Puck, Ariel), the play-within-a-play in *MND* and the masque in *The Tempest*, the epilogues about theatre. Finally, conversation touched on the subjects  of forgiveness and prayer.
* The epilogue for its revision of Prospero's character, Prospero's speech in which he remarks "we are such stuff as dreams are made on" for it's insight into theatre and humanity, Caliban's speech on the "sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not" (for its poetry and apparent contradiction with what else is seemingly known of Caliban), Prospero's speech in which he abjures his magic ((1) for setting up a non-magical, though perhaps divine reconciliation and (2) for suggesting that Prospero's tyranny, so to speak, was due ony to the injustices he suffered) were all selected as key passages. It was also pointed out that Prospero's renunciciation of magic occurs after he talks with Ariel about empathy.   

## Week 3
Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 24 

* Read *Macbeth* and Palfrey's essay on Macbeth's verse &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and give an impressionistic analysis of a verse passage (see Palfrey for examples)

Tuesday, Jan. 24 &mdash; *Macbeth*
* Our discussion dwelt on four major topics: (1) the construction of the play &ndash; is the play's progress an inevitable sequence or something like a dissolution, or spinning out of control? (2) the moral code within the play, is there one? what is it? how does Macbeth relate to it? (3) the relationship between and characterization of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth; and (4) Macbeth's emotional state in act 5.
* Two of the play's most famous speeches--Macbeth's final soliloquy and Lady Macbeth's "Out, damned spot" speech--were selected as key passages, but so too were Lady Macbeth's remark that "Had he not resembled / My father as I slept, I had done't" and Macduff's decision to go to Fife (2.4.36), which marks "the disintegration of the play...while events are concentrated he can act decisively endash; it is only when he must start operating at a distance from thh action that things go awry." 

Preparation for Friday, Jan. 27 

* Read *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* and McDonad on Sh's metrical development &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and give an impressionistic analysis of a verse passage

Friday, Jan. 27 &mdash; *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* 
* The class was devoted to meter and metrical analysis.
* Students identified several key passages in this "really stupid play." We see "the very bottom of Proteus's mind" in 2.6.1-43, while Proteus's slightly earlier speech at 2.4.190-212 motivates the plot. The nobler Valentine's speech at 3.1.170-87 makes clear that "Valentine and Proteus are fools in their conceptions of love," and Julia's tautologous remark that "I have no other, but a woman's reason: / I think him so because I think him so" suggests that women's love is irrational. Proteus's first soliloquy (1.1.63-9) sets up a confict between love and honor that will be pursued throughout the play. 

## Week 4
Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 31 

* Read *Julius Caesar* and Wright's essay on scanning Sh's meter &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and scan a speech from the play (Brutus's speech "Under your pardon," etc., suggested)

Tuesday, Jan. 31 &mdash; *Julius Caesar* 
* We discussed the importance of oratory in the play. Although some objected to what they saw as the play's thin characterization, others thought that this characterization put us as readers in the place of the plebians, having to decide issues based on speeches alone and not without any insider knowledge. It was aruged that most of the characters had 'abortive arcs,' and that the real emphasis was on certain show pieces: the killing of Caesar, for example, and Antony's funeral oration. The scenes in which Brutus talks with Portia and Caesar with Calpurnia were contrasted as a way into the question of where the political ended and the personal began for these men. It was also asked why the play mentioned Caesar's physical ailments, especially the "falling sickness"? Is he therefore less fit to rule? Or is he more sympathetic? Brutus's character was scrutinized: is he noble but stupid? Finally, the supernatural elements were touched on. 
* Antony's famous speech in 3.2 was identified by all but one student as the key passage of the play. The other proposal was Brutus's speech at 2.1.113-39, which marks a step towards assassination and perhaps a rejection on Brutus's part "of the divine influence that comes with an oath, for the purely secular political reasoning of love of Rome and hatred of tyranny."

Preparation for Feb. 3 

* Read *Twelfth Night* and Nash's essay on puns &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the significance of a key passage, identify and explicate 2 puns from the play, and give a metrical analysis of Orsino's first speech, "If music be the food of love," etc.

Friday, Feb. 3 &mdash; *Twelfth Night*

* *Twelfth Night* was not a hit with the class. Much of our session was spent in puzzlement over what Shakespeare was up to: it is "unbalanced," there's a "lack of character development," it is full of "idle humor" and in the play "nothing happens." Malvolio, it was thought, was the only sympathetic character, and he was hard done by. There were a few attempts to save the play. It was suggested that the play was a study of humor and revelry; another student suggested that the play was an experiment in stage-craft (in which dialogue becomes more important than plot); another proposed the idea that the play is a good one if it is seen as the romance of Sir Toby and Maria. After this session, students read a little anthology of criticism on character and drama, available [here](./florilegium).
* Key passages: The opening speech of the play was selected for introducing recurring themes about (unrequited) love throughout the play. Similarly, in the "eloquent" 2.4.93-103, Orsino "gives his theory of love and women." Cesario's passionate declaration to Olivia ("Make me a willow cabin," etc) sets up the love triangle between Olivia, Viola, and Orsino. In 3.1.59-67, Viola recognizes "the intelligence and importance of a professional fool." While in 3.1.148-55, Olivia's rhymed speech to Cesario offers an alternative vision of love ("unsought is better") from what is elsewhere offered in the play. 5.1 resolves the Malvolio plot-line. 

## Week 5

Preparation for Tuesday, Feb. 7
* Read *The Taming of the Shrew* and Palfrey on puns &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the significance of a key passage, identify and explicate 2 puns from the play.

Tuesday, Feb. 7 &mdash; *The Taming of the Shrew* 

* *The Taming of the Shrew* prompted a lively discussion on the nature of comedy and drama. Was Kate's "taming" and her final speech required by the comic form? Should she be thought of as a person, a mere character, or a device in a play? Is the end comically justified by her "particular instransigence"? Or, is the play somehow a feminist one, which illustrates, by contrast with Kate's sudden taming, the lifelong taming to which all women are subject? What, if any, is the "ethical content" of the play? Is Kate's final speech, and the progress of the play as a whole, a commentary on social mores, a ethical injunction, a play with socially-available tropes? There was also debate regarding the purpose and function of the induction: an irrelevancy or a distancing device? 
* Kate's long final speech was widely considered the most significant in the play: the play's moral, proof that the shrew as been tamed, or as evidence of the most radical development of any character we have read so far. The lone alternative passage selected occured in 2.1 when Kate, having denied Petruchio's announcement that they have agreed to be married, "gives up and resigns herself to the wedding less than 30 lines after her initial dissent."  

Preparation for Friday, Feb. 10 
* Read *Much Ado About Nothing* and McDonald on 'double talk' &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the significance of a key passage, identify and explicate 2 puns from the play.

Friday, Feb. 10 &mdash; *Much Ado About Nothing* 

* Conversation centered around the tone of the play, a "dark comedy" it was called. The play, it seemed, could end tragically. And even with an awareness of the potentially happy end, Claudio's slanderous outburst at the wedding, Hero's (feigned) death, the funeral and "sincere" epitaph for Hero, the falling out between Claudio and Benedick, and, behind it all, the malicious, envious, and pathetic Don John, all gave the comedy weight which was deemed missing from *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and *Twelfth Night.* The importance of mishearing, disguise, and the "fake climax" of Don Pedro's supposed wooing of Hero (in his own name) were also touched on. After much discussion of the Hero and Claudio plot, attention turned to Benedick and Beatrice. Despite some attention to the "density" of their comic wordplay, the focus was on the nature of their relationship: are they already in love, is their relationship a good one? Near the end of class, a student pointed out that, curiously, after the session on *Taming of the Shrew,* little attention was paid to the demands of genre, or the possible dramatic functions, their relationship could serve.  
* Key passage: Most thought the key scene was the wedding scene: Claudio's speech ("Oh Hero! What a Hero hadst thou been") and Leonato's speech lamenting Hero's "infamy" were both selected as significant. Also, the masquerade scene entire was picked out. 

## Week 6
Preparation for Tuesday, Feb. 14
* Read *The Merchant of Venice* and either Bailey, "Shylock and the Slaves"; Smith, "Was Shylock Jewish?"; or Kietzman, "Shylock and Covenantal Interplay" &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the significance of a key passage, and write a brief precis (300 words) of the article you selected
