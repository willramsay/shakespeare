Friday, Jan. 20 &mdash; *The Tempest*

* A theme in our discussion of *The Tempest* was Prospero: what is the nature of his magic? is he an analogue to the playwright? to what degree is he a 'moral' character? And indeed it was proposed that *The Tempest*, unlike *MND* is a character study, focusing on Prospero, Ariel, and especially Caliban. Is Caliban rational? What is the significance of the fact that his speeches are in verse? What to make of his attempted rape of Miranda? Why is he enslaved? What happens to him at the end of the play? But despite the proposed contrast with *MND* similarities were also pointed out: omnipotent characters (Prospero, Oberon), agents (Puck, Ariel), the play-within-a-play in *MND* and the masque in *The Tempest*, the epilogues about theatre. Finally, conversation touched on the subjects  of forgiveness and prayer.
* The epilogue for its revision of Prospero's character, Caliban's speech on the "sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not" (for its poetry and apparent contradiction with what else is seemingly known of Caliban), Prospero's speech in which he abjures his magic ((1) for setting up a non-magical, though perhaps divine reconciliation and (2) for suggesting that Prospero's tyranny, so to speak, was due ony to the injustices he suffered) were all selected as key passages. It was also pointed out that Prospero's reunciciation of magic occurs after he talks with Ariel about empathy.   

## Week 3
Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 24 

* Read *Macbeth* and Palfrey's essay on Macbeth's verse &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and give an impressionistic analysis of a verse passage (see Palfrey for examples)

Tuesday, Jan. 24 &mdash; *Macbeth*
* Our discussion dwelt on four major topics: (1) the construction of the play &ndash is the play's progress an inevitable sequence or something like a dissolution, or spinning out of control? (2) the moral code within the play, is there one? what is it? how does Macbeth relate to it? (3) the relationship between and characterization of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth; and (4) Macbeth's emotional state in act 5.
* 

Preparation for Friday, Jan. 27 

* Read *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* and McDonad on Sh's metrical development &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and give an impressionistic analysis of a verse passage

Friday, Jan. 27 &mdash; *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* 
* The class was devoted to meter and metrical analysis.
* Students identified several key passages in this "really stupid play." We see "the very bottom of Proteus's mind" in 2.6.1-43, while Proteus's slightly earlier speech at 2.4.190-212 motivates the plot. The nobler Valentine's speech at 3.1.170-87 makes clear that "Valentine and Proteus are fools in their conceptions of love," and Julia's tautologous remark that "I have no other, but a woman's reason: / I think him so because I think him so" suggests that women's love is irrational. Proteus's first soliloquy (1.1.63-9) sets up a confict between love and honor that will be pursued throughout the play. 

## Week 4
Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 31 

* Read *Julius Caesar* and Wright's essay on scanning Sh's meter &mdash; outline the play, identify and explain the importance of a key passage, and scan a speech from the play (Brutus's speech "Under your pardon," etc., suggested)

Tuesday, Jan. 31 &mdash; *Julius Caesar* 
* We discussed the importance of oratory in the play. Although some objected to what they saw as the play's thin characterization, others thought that this characterization put us as readers in the place of the plebians, having to decide issues based on speeches alone and not without any insider knowledge. It was aruged that most of the characters had 'abortive arcs,' and that the real emphasis was on certain show pieces: the killing of Caesar, for example, and Antony's funeral oration. The scenes in which Brutus talks with Portia and Caesar with Calpurnia were contrasted as a way into the question of where the political ended and the personal began for these men. It was also asked why the play mentioned Caesar's physical ailments, especially the "falling sickness"? Is he therefore less fit to rule? Or is he more sympathetic? Brutus's character was scrutinized: is he noble but stupid? Finally, the supernatural elements were touched on. 
* Antony's famous speech in 3.2 was identified by all but one student as the key passage of the play. The other proposal was Brutus's speech at 2.1.113-39, which marks a step towards assassination and perhaps a rejection on Brutus's part "of the divine influence that comes with an oath, for the purely secular political reasoning of love of Rome and hatred of tyranny."
